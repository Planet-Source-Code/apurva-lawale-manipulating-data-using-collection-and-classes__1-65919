## Manipulating Data using Collection and Classes


</div>

### Description

Shows how a VB Class and Collections can be used to manipulate data in memory. A very simple example showing some intermediate-advanced stuff of data manipulation.

To handle a lot of data newbies normally use arrays so I hope this example will help them understand Collections + Classes and appreciate their worth. You could use the technique showed in this example to manipulate data in memory

then you could save it in an XML file or database. You could load database table info and manipulate it / update it. You could do a lot with much less code without breaking a sweat.

The code in Employee and EmployeeCollection classes are commented.

Understand those two classes. They are pretty small.

The comments should help you understand them well.

I recommend you look at the Employee Class first and understand

Then look at the EmployeeCollection Class

Then read the code in this form.

Vote if you like this small elegant solution. Voting much appreciated.
